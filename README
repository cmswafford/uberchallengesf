I chose to implement the SF Movies app.

I used Google App Engine to host the code because of its ease and availability. There isn't any
backend processing in main.py except setting up the routing.

I used Google Maps and their geocoding API for the first time.

Clicking a movie from the Movies list automatically fills the search input and executes the search.
Alternatively, the user can start typing a movie title and jQuery UI autocomplete will suggest movies.

Once a movie is chosen, I put pins on the map at each of the film locations for that movie. These locations
are listed below the movie title (which links to IMDB). Hovering over each location in this list shows 
only that pin on the map so that the user can highlight individual locations. Each pin also has a title
attribute of the address name that shows if you hover on the pin.
